What type of data you chose to send?
How this type of data would contribute to a robotics system (e.g., navigation, control, sensing)?

==============================================================================================================

For the project, I chose to utilize the turtle topics/nodes for the submission. This is because after watching 
the YouTube playlist on ROS2, the examples he gave using turtle had a lot of potential, and I felt I could build 
something cool from there. The data being sent uses the /turtle1/pose topic to retrieve information like x,y, and 
linear/angular velocity from the turtle. Additionally, I added a distance from center variable to track approximately 
how far the turtle is from the midpoint using simple Pythagorean. 

This data would contribute to a robotics system by informing users of the robot's position relative to a stage/setting and other entities. 
Knowing the angular and linear velocity could also tell you how the robot is gonna move and lets you predict its path. 
The distance from center could also be used to fetch distances from relative entities like known objects or obstructions.
